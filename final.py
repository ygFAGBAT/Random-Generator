"""Final project: Random Writer that can save its model.

NOTE: This is a long file, however I strongly recommend you read the
whole thing BEFORE starting on the project.

In this project you will write a "random writer": a program that
builds a statistical model of some data and then outputs a stream of
data that is similar to the original but randomly generated. Here is
how we will do it: [The idea for this assignment is from an assignment
that Dr Calvin Lin uses for CS314H. He was nice enough to let me use
his text to explain it.]

Imagine taking a book, such as Tom Sawyer, and determining the
probability with which each character occurs. You'd probably find that
spaces are the most common character, followed by the character "e",
etc. Given these probabilities, which we will call a Level 0 analysis,
you could randomly produce text that, while not resembling English,
would have the property that the characters would likely occur in the
same proportions as they do in Tom Sawyer. For example, here's what
you might produce:

  rla bsht eS ststofo hhfosdsdewno oe wee h .mr ae irii ela iad o r te
  ut mnyto onmalysnce, ifu en c fDwn oee

Now imagine doing a slightly more sophisticated analysis, a Level 1
analysis, that determines the probability with which each character
follows every other character. You would probably discover that "h"
follows "t" more frequently than "x" does, and you would probably
discover that a space follows a period more frequently than a comma
does.  With this new analysis, you could use the probabilities from
Tom Sawyer to randomly pick an initial character and then repeatedly
choose the next character based on the previous character and the
probabilities provided by the analysis. Your new text might look like
the following, which looks a bit more like English than the previous
example:

  "Shand tucthiney m?" le ollds mind Theybooue He, he s whit Pereg
  lenigabo Jodind alllld ashanthe ainofevids tre lin-p asto oun
  theanthadomoere

We can generalize these ideas to a Level k analysis that determines
the probability with which each character follows every possible
sequence of k characters. For example, a Level 5 analysis of Tom
Sawyer would show that "r" follows "Sawye" more frequently than any
other character. After a Level k analysis, you'd be able to produce
random text by always choosing the next character based on the
previous k characters -- which we will call the state -- and based on
the probabilities produced by your analysis.

For relatively small values of k (5-7), the randomly generated text
begins to take on many of the characteristics of the source text.
While it still will not produce legal English, you will be able to
tell that it was derived from Tom Sawyer instead of Harry Potter. As
the value of k increases, the text looks increasingly like English.
Here are some more examples:

Level 2:
  "Yess been." for gothin, Tome oso; ing, in to weliss of an'te cle -
  armit.  Paper a comeasione, and smomenty, fropech hinticer, sid, a
  was Tom, be such tied. He sis tred a youck to themen

Level 4:
  en themself, Mr. Welshman, but him awoke, the balmy shore.  I'll
  give him that he couple overy because in the slated snuffindeed
  structure's kind was rath.  She said that the wound the door a fever
  eyes that WITH him.

Level 6:
  people had eaten, leaving. Come - didn't stand it better judgment;
  His hands and bury it again, tramped herself! She'd never would
  be. He found her spite of anything the one was a prime feature
  sunset, and hit upon that of the forever.

Level 8:
  look-a-here - I told you before, Joe.  I've heard a pin drop.  The
  stillness was complete, how-ever, this is awful crime, beyond the
  village was sufficient.  He would be a good enough to get that
  night, Tom and Becky.

Level 10:
  you understanding that they don't come around in the cave should get
  the word "beauteous" was over-fondled, and that together" and
  decided that he might as we used to do - it's nobby fun. I'll learn
  you."

We can also generalize this idea to use words in place of characters
as the "tokens" of the model. In fact we can generalize this process
to work over any sequence of values of any type. The states are then
short sequences of values.

Formally, the model we are building here is called a Markov Chain. A
Markov chain is a directed graph where every node is a state and every
outgoing edge from a node is a possible token to find while in that
state. The edges have probabilities that define how likely it is to
follow that edge. The probability of all the edges leaving a node
should sum to 1.

With this graph we can generate output by picking a random starting
node and then picking an outgoing edge based on the probabilities,
outputting it's associated token, and repeating the process based on
the node at the other end of the edge.

More concretely you can think of being in a state represented by a
string "th". We would then look at the probability that each other
letter would follow "th". "e" is likely to be very common; "x" not so
much. If we generate the "e", we are in state "he" and we check
probabilities based on that state.

Feel free to discuss the Markov chain with one another or look it
up. However you should not discuss how to implement it or copy an
existing implementation.

NOTE: This module can be used in various modes (level, tokenization,
etc). However, you should NOT need to reimplement large blocks of code
for each case. Instead, think about what actually changes from mode to
mode and use conditionals around only those part. You may even want to
write some utility methods which perform some abstract operations in
the appropriate way for the current mode. In the end, just remember
how much I hate duplicated or messy code as you handle all the cases.

"""

"""You will need to turn in 2 different modules (final.py and graph.py).
"""

"""TODO: Create a Tokenization enum with values: word, character,
byte, none (name them exactly this; do not capitolize). Use the
enumeration support in the standard library. The tokenization modes
have the following meanings:

word: Interpret the input as UTF-8 and split the input at any
  white-space characters and use the strings between the white-space
  as tokens. So "a b" would be ["a", "b"] as would "a\n b".

character: Interpret the input as UTF-8 and use the characters as
  tokens.

byte: Read the input as raw bytes and use individual bytes as the
  tokens.

none: Do not tokenize. The input must be an iterable.

"""

"""TODO: Create a module called 'graph' (make sure the file name is exactly
'graph.py') that contains class(es) and code that are used to represent and
manipulate the Markov chain graph. It should implement the Markov chain as an
abstract concept and not have any code specific to this usage. Also it should
use objects to represent the graph structure, instead of encoding relationships
as some opaque set of tables.

The API of the module is up to you, but it should be an API which I could use
to implement a different Markov-chain-related system without changing it. So
try to make the API generic and not specific to this application. I will be
grading the generality of the graph module.

NOTE: Do not optimized your graph representation. Just represent it in
the simplest way you can. That's how I implemented mine and it runs the
whole test suite in 9 seconds which is plenty fast enough for our
application and actually much faster than most implementations people
turn in.

"""

"""In implementing the algorithms required for this project you should
not focus too much on performance however you should make sure your
code can train on a large data set in a reasonable time. For instance,
a 6MB input file on level 4 should not take more than 10 seconds.
Similarly you should be able to generate output quickly; 5,000 tokens
per second or better. These should be easy to meet without any
optimization if you use the correct data structures (e.g., dicts when
you need fast lookup by a key).
